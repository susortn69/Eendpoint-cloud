# Mandatory Tasks

This repository hosts multiple assignments for the \"Endpoint og sky\" course. Each task lives in its own folder so the original deliverables stay intact.

## Repository layout
- Task1/ : FastAPI authentication service (registration, login, info, delete) with 1-minute JWT expiry.
- Task2/ : Builds on Task 1 by adding logging, Docker/Compose setup, and README run instructions.
- Task3/ : Persists data in Postgres, adds admin candidate management, and user voting endpoints.
- Task4/ : Postman test suite instructions and exported artifacts for Task 3.

## Working with a task
1. cd TaskX
2. Follow the task-specific README for setup and commands.
3. Keep .env files out of version control; copy from example.env.txt.

Feel free to extend with additional tasks using the same structure.
